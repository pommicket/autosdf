#    you can set this to 0.5 to render the SDF at half resolution for example
#    (e.g. the SDF will be rendered at 960x540 on a 1080p monitor)
#    making this lower will increase performance significantly, but will look more pixelated
#    you can also make this higher to take super high-res screenshots (but it will run slower)
scale 1
#    complexity of SDF
#    making this bigger will make more complex scenes, but will require more gpu computation
sdf-length 600
#    complexity of color function
#    making this bigger will make more complex colors, but will require more gpu computation
color-length 300
#    max raymarching iterations
#    making this bigger will make boundaries less "blurry", but will require more gpu computation

#    raymarching distance threshold
#    (how close to distance 0 should the SDF get before we draw?)
distance-threshold 0.02
#    antialiasing factors
#    e.g. use 2 for 2x2 MSAA
#    this will make the scene look a bit nicer, but will require MUCH MORE gpu computation.

#    set this to 1 to use HSV instead of RGB for color

#    set this to 1 to automatically start playing SDFs when they load

#    by default, vsync is enabled, so you don't need to change this unless you want
